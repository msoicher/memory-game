# Memory Game

This project is a basic memory game I built for fun.
It was a challenge proposed by popular Youtube Web Developer [Web Dev Cody](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UcfBfSP2T4&t=1425s&ab_channel=WebDevCody). 

The repository was scaffolded using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), a new scaffolding tool that is faster than create-react-app.

There are a few enhancements I'd like to make, like adding a timer and maintaining a score. Hopefully I can come back to that later.

## How to Run

A live version of this game exists [here](https://matts-memory-game.netlify.app/). I used Netlify to deploy the site.

If you want to run this locally, simply clone this repo and run 
`yarn` to build the dependencies.

Then, run
`yarn dev` to start the local server.

Happy guessing!
